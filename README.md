```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Command-Line Interface

#### 1. Save Your Database Connection Details (Optional)

You can securely store your connection details for easier access:

```bash
peepdb <connection_name> --save --db-type [mysql/postgres/mariadb] --host <host> --user <user> --password <password> --database <database>
```

#### 2. List Saved Connections

To view all saved database connections:

```bash
peepdb --list
```

#### 3. View All Tables or a Specific Table

To view all tables in the database:

```bash
peepdb <connection_name>
```

To view a specific table:

```bash
peepdb <connection_name> --table <table_name>
```

#### 4. Choose Output Format

By default, peepDB displays data in a formatted table. You can also get the output in JSON format:

```bash
peepdb <connection_name> --format json
```

#### 5. Remove Saved Connections

To remove a specific saved connection:

```bash
peepdb --remove <connection_name>
```

To remove all saved connections:

```bash
peepdb --remove-all
```

> **Note:** Both of these commands will ask for confirmation before proceeding with the removal.

### Examples

1. **Save MySQL connection details:**

   ```bash
   peepdb myapp_db --save --db-type mysql --host localhost --user root --password mypassword --database myapp
   ```

2. **View all tables in the saved MySQL database:**

   ```bash
   peepdb myapp_db
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   Table: users
   +----+----------+----------------------+
   | id | username | email                |
   +====+==========+======================+
   |  1 | john_doe | john.doe@example.com |
   +----+----------+----------------------+
   |  2 | jane_doe | jane.doe@example.com |
   +----+----------+----------------------+

   Table: orders
   +----+---------+------------+--------+
   | id | user_id | order_date | total  |
   +====+=========+============+========+
   |  1 |       1 | 2023-05-01 | 100.00 |
   +----+---------+------------+--------+
   |  2 |       2 | 2023-05-02 | 150.50 |
   +----+---------+------------+--------+
   ```

3. **View a specific table:**

   ```bash
   peepdb myapp_db --table users
   ```

4. **Get output in JSON format:**

   ```bash
   peepdb myapp_db --format json
   ```

   Output:
   ```json
   {
     "users": [
       {"id": 1, "username": "john_doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"},
       {"id": 2, "username": "jane_doe", "email": "jane.doe@example.com"}
     ],
     "orders": [
       {"id": 1, "user_id": 1, "order_date": "2023-05-01", "total": 100.00},
       {"id": 2, "user_id": 2, "order_date": "2023-05-02", "total": 150.50}
     ]
   }
   ```

5. **Use PostgreSQL without saving details:**

   ```bash
   peepdb analytics_db --save --db-type postgres --host localhost --user postgres --password mypassword --database analytics
   ```

## üîí Security

peepDB uses encryption to securely store your database connection details. The encryption key is stored in your user directory (~/.peepdb/key.key). Make sure to keep this key safe and do not share it.
